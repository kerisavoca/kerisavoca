### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineering manager in the infrastructure / DevOps space, working on internal development platforms. My philosophy is that platform teams are product teams, but with internal users. 

Outside of work (where I fight a bunch of fires), I enjoy building all sorts of web applications. Creating delightful user experiences is refreshing.

### Tools & technologies

My recent work has involved React, Typescript, Node, Go, Figma, Storybook, GCP, AWS, Kubernetes, CircleCI, and Terraform.
