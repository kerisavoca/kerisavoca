### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineering manager in the infrastructure / DevOps space. I enjoy working on internal development platforms. My philosophy is that platform teams are product teams with internal users. 

Outside of work, I enjoy solving complex problems and building delightful user interfaces.

### Tools & technologies

My recent work has involved React, Typescript, Node, Go, Figma, Storybook, GCP, AWS, Kubernetes, CircleCI, and Terraform.
